💁‍♂️ I'm **Kirian CAUMES**, a **24 years old** **full stack developer**, located near **Nantes, France** 🇫🇷.

👨‍🎓 I've been working in the IT industry for more than **5 years** now. My studies at Ynov Nantes with my master's degree in "**Web Development Expert**" as well as my professional career have allowed me to acquire solid and adaptive skills.

👷‍♂️ This **technical knowledge**, also acquired thanks to my good understanding of English, was expressed around the realization (in particular) of **business web applications** but also in **project management** and **customer relations**.

👍 A few technologies I like and often work with : **NodeJS** (Nest, Express), **Javascript/Typescript** (React, Vanilla, PWA), **Deno**, **SGBD** (MSSQL, Mongo, MySQL), **.NET Core**, **PHP** (Symfony, Wordpress), and more...
