💁‍♂️ I'm **Kirian CAUMES**, a **27 years old** **full stack developer**, located near **Nantes, France** 🇫🇷.

👨‍🎓 I've been working in the IT industry for more than **8 years** now. My studies at Ynov Nantes with my master's degree in "**Web Development Expert**" and my RNCP title "**IT and Information Systems Expert**", as well as my professional career, have allowed me to acquire solid and adaptive skills.

📖 On Github, I also share Open Source projects that I work on in my free time. Their main objective is to resolve my various small daily problems and perhaps also yours.
