# Hello there 👋

💁‍♂️ I'm **Kirian CAUMES**, a **26 years old** **full stack developer**, located near **Nantes, France** 🇫🇷.

👨‍🎓 I've been working in the IT industry for more than **5 years** now. My studies at Ynov Nantes with my master's degree in "**Web Development Expert**" and my RNCP title "**IT and Information Systems Expert**", as well as my professional career, have allowed me to acquire solid and adaptive skills.

👷‍♂️ This **technical knowledge**, also acquired thanks to my good understanding of English, was expressed around the realization (in particular) of **business web applications** but also in **project management** and **customer relations**.

👍 A few technologies I like and often work with : **Javascript/Typescript** (React, Next.js, Vanilla, PWA), **NodeJS** (Nest, Express), **Deno**, **SGBD** (MSSQL, Mongo, PostgreSQL, MySQL), **.NET Core** (C#), **Python**, **Azure**, **PHP** (Symfony, Wordpress), and many more...
